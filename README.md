# Appointment Tracker

This is a small front-end appointment tracking application built in React. Users can create appointments with a title, date and time. Appointments are then shown in chronological order (soonest appointment first), and can be deleted. Past appointments are displayed in a separate list below the upcoming appointments.

As this app is front-end only, there is no data persistence and appointments will be wiped on refresh.
